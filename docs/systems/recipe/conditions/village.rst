Village
=======

Break Down:
-----------

The Village condition has a single optional field, inVillage, which defaults to true, which controls whether you must be
in a village, or must not be in a village.

Example:
--------

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type": "base:village",
        "inVillage": false
    }
